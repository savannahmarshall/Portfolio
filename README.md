The purpose of this project was to create a portfolio that I can use to showcase my work and continue to update as I develop my programming skillset by completing more projects.

On the upper right section of the page is the navigation area. There are links titled “about me”, “work” and “contact me” that will scroll to the corresponding section when you click on them. In the section titled “my work”, you will find four different images that, once selected, will take you to my deployed projects. As of right now, only the first project has any real content. The others are acting as place holders until I have completed more work.

While completing this project, I learned how to separate elements using margins and padding and how to manipulate containers using flexbox. I also gained a deeper understanding of how HTML elements interact with CSS styling because I had to create many classes to get the desired final product. The page should have a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport. I did face some challenges with accomplishing this, but I hope that feedback will help me improve this skill.
